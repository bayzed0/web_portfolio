            <h3>Only Thing That Could Tear Down...The Dragon Was Itself</h3>
            <p>Dragons can fly, breathe fire, and are extremely powerful, strong, and intelligent creatures. Their hard
                scales cannot be easily pierced by swords, arrows, and other weaponry. Dragons also have deadly poisons
                in their teeth and claws.</p>

                <p>Komodo dragons are living, breathing dragons, even if they don't breathe fire. But that doesn't mean
                    they aren't really cool—and fierce—reptiles. Komodo dragons are the largest of lizards, and there
                    are 3,000 kinds of those! They live on only five islands in southeastern Indonesia.
